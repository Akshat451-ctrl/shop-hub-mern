# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - Quick Commands

## Your CORS Issue is Fixed!

I've updated your `backend/server.js` with the correct CORS configuration.

## Deploy in 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. Add changes
git add .

# 2. Commit
git commit -m "Fix: CORS configuration for production deployment"

# 3. Push (Render will auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

## Wait 2-3 Minutes

Render will automatically:
1. Detect the push
2. Rebuild your backend
3. Deploy the new version

## Then Seed Database

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```
